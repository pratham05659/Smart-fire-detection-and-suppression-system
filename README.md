### **How to Use This in Your GitHub Repo?**  
1. **Create a `LICENSE` file** in your repository.  
2. **Copy-paste** the above text into it.  
3. **Replace placeholders** `[Your Project Name]`, `[Year]`, and `[Your Name or Company]` with your details.  
4. In your **README.md**, add a link to the `LICENSE` file under the **License** section.

This will ensure your license is well-formatted in both **GitHub** and any **code editor** like **VS Code, Sublime Text, or JetBrains IDEs**.  

Let me know if you need modifications!
